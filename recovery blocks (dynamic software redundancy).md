 4 phases
- Error detection
	- Detection by the environment (processor, [[run time system]], OS)
	- Detection by the application: detection via
		- replication (N versions)
		- time measurements (can be noticed by scheduler, see [[Chapter 13 Tolerating timing faults]])
		- reverse calculations: `sqrt()`
		- coding check: `checksum`
		- reasonable check: value range
		- dynamic reasonable check: output makes no large jumps
		- structural check of data structures: linked list
- Damage confinement and assessment: time may have elapsed between the occurrence of a fault and the detection of the error which is following it. Two structural approaches
	- modular decomposition (static)
		- System divided into components, components interact through well-defined interfaces. 
		- Internal data of modules are hidden and protected.
		- limit the error propagation
	- [[atomic action]] (dynamic)
- Error recovery
	-  [[forward recovery]] and [[backward recovery]]
- treatment of error: Solving of the problem so it does not re-occur. 2 phases:
	- precise fault detection
	- recovery from error
