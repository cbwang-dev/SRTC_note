1. safety: errors can be avoided by language, or are discovered by compiler
	- con: complicated difficult compiler
2. readability: choice of keywords, definition of new types, support for modules
	- pros: lower costs, better security, easy documentation, better maintainability
	- cons: longer programs
3. flexibility/completeness: express required operations without need for support of OS
4. simplicity: lower cost for compiler and training programmers
5. portability: independent of hardware, splitting machine dependent and independent parts. Java: write once, run anywhere
6. efficient
