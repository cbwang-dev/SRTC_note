characteristics of simple process model:
- fixed number of processes
- all processes are periodic, known periods
- independent processes
- neglect system overhead
- all processes have a deadline equal to periods
- all processes have a known [[worst case execution time]]
	- used in [[response time analysis for FPS]] as $C$.
