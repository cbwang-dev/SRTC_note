sporadic is different from aperiodic:
- aperiodic, activated randomly through external events, the worst case analysis on aperiodic executions is impossible
- sporadic: aperiodic with a minimum delay between two executions (minimal inter-arrival time). the worst case analysis on sporadic executions is possible
