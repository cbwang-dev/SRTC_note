- heap memory (the only memory area for [[Java garbage collector]])
- scoped memory (object lifetime of the lexical scope, not for [[Java garbage collector]])
	- allocated objects have a limited lifetime
		- reference count per scoped memory area, decrease per termination
		- when reference count reaches 0: all finalizers are executed, all objects (memory) are reclaimable
- immortal memory (object lifetime of the application)
	- freed only when program terminates
- physical memory (may be immortal or scoped, map to specific physical memory)
	- physical memory access: placing objects in specific types of memory like RAM, [[direct memory access]], [[memory mapped IO]]
