- RT tasks
	- Ada and C/POSIX have no syntactic difference between RT and ordinary tasks
	- RT Java offers a difference by `RealtimeThread extends java.lang.Thread`
		- managed by a scheduler
		- can use other memory instead of heap (see [[Chapter 14 Low Level Programming]])
	- RT Java have attributes [[real time threads in RTSJ]]
		- `ReleaseParameters` 
			- contain info like deadline, periodic/sporadic, etc. 
			- releases have an associated cost, often the [[worst case execution time]] of the RT thread
		- `SchedulingParameters`
		- `MemoryParameters` (see [[Chapter 14 Low Level Programming]])
		- `ProcessingGroupParameters` to treat a group of tasks as a whole (eg. same deadline)
- programming periodic activities
	- Ada and C/POSIX: nothing specific, can be done through other mechanisms
		- Ada: via `delay until`
		- C/POSIX: via `sleep()` or `clock_nanosleep()`
	- RT Java offers specific things:  `PeriodicParameters extends ReleaseParameters`
		- 2 extra parameters: period and starting time
		- with routine `WaitForNextPeriod` to be used at the end of a loop
- programming aperiodic and [[sporadic]] activities
	- Ada and C/POSIX: nothing specific
	- RT Java offers specific things: possibilities to limit the queue of waiting aperiodic tasks
- event handlers (only principles)
- control jitter (only principles)
