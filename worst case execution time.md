0. summary
1. what is it?
	1. the longest time that a task can take to execute
2. what does it do? 
3. how does it work? 
	1. worst case execution time can be measured both by measurement and analytically
		1. by measurement: not sure the worst time has been measured (con)
		2. analytically: divide code into basic blocks. Measure time of each blocks. Add block in worst case combination (max loop, longest option of 'case'). All loops and recursion must be limited.
4. where is it used?
	1. in [[Chapter 11 Scheduling (important)]] -> [[simple process model]]
	2. and others for sporadic events
5. when is it used?
6. what are the potential problems? 
7. what are the pros and cons?
	1. pros
	2. cons
		1. hard to measure, especially when there is interactions between tasks
8. what are the possible alternatives?
