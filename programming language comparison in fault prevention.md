- strong typing: No implicit type conversion, clearer code at time of compilation.
- clear unambiguous syntax: Makes the code easy to interpret and discover mistakes (protected objects vs a dozen of semaphores)
- runtime check
- support modularity and data abstraction: allows you to focus on the bigger picture and reduces the complexity. For example classes (OOP) provide data abstraction.
