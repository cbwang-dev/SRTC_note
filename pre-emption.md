In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting an executing task, with the intention of resuming it at a later time. This interrupt is done by an external scheduler with no assistance or cooperation from the task. This preemptive scheduler usually run in the most privileged protection ring, meaning that interruption and resuming are considered highly secure actions. Such a change in the currently executing task of a processor is known as [[context switch]].
