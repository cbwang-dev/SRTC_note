- problem statement:  
	- producer-consumer problem 
	- use shared circular buffer
- in need for conditional synchronization
	- consumer should wait when buffer is empty
	- producer should wait when buffer is full
- [[critical section]] and conditional synchronization
	- in the producer-consumer problem, there might be a [[data race]], so we need [[critical section]]
	- dealing with [[critical section]] and conditional synchronization: 6 solutions
		- solution 1: busy waiting, suspend/resume: we pass this 
		- solution 2: [[semaphore]]
			- used in POSIX
			- [[binary semaphores]] and [[quantity semaphores]]
		- solution 3: conditional [[critical section]]
			- a code segment with guarantee for execution with [[mutual exclusion]] and with the possibility of conditional synchronization
			- how
				- group of variables protected in code segments that get a name (in Ada, `region`)
				- guard for conditional synchronization
			-  cons
				-  the code-segments can be spread in an unstructured manner over the program
				-  a process that waits to enter a region must, every time there is a different process, be made active to test the guard
		- solution 4: [[monitor in C POSIX]]  [[condition variables]]
		- solution 5: synchronized classes in Java 
		- solution 6: [[protected objects in Ada]]
